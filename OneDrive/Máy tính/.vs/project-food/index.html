        Burger is a famous fast food with fragrant golden crust, soft meat and
        fresh green vegetables. Slices of fatty cheese and rich sauce contribute
        to the attractiveness of the dish. The perfect blend of flavors creates
        a delicious, nutritious dish for all diners. Burger is famous for its 4
        main fillings including chicken, beef, shrimp and unique crab cakes. The
        fillings are carefully selected to ensure the freshness, firmness and
        sweetness of each meat fiber. The rich Burger meat is fried in a medium
        heat to help preserve the softness of the meat. The crust is baked
        crispy and spongy with the fragrant aroma of sesame. To add more fiber
        to the meal, layers of fresh vegetables are neatly arranged under the
        meat. This helps the crust not to absorb water and still retain the
        crispy, fragrant texture like it was just baked. Just hearing about it
        makes you crave it, so let's go eat it right away!

            You’ve tried tuna salad and chicken salad, but have you ever eaten
            salmon salad? You can make this healthy high-protein lunch with
            leftover salmon or poach it in the microwave in two minutes! If
            you need a healthy salad loaded with omega-3s, you’ll love this
            easy salmon salad. It only takes 5 minutes to make! I love it on
            toasted sourdough bread or everything bagels, but there are so
            many ways to eat it. I poach a piece of salmon in the microwave,
            but you can also make it with my air fryer salmon or baked salmon.
            Then flake the fish, and add celery, red onions, just a little
            mayo, fresh lemon juice, salt, and pepper.
